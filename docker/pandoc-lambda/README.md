## Testing

### To test the new sectioning code, 

Either 
1) log in with an admin account and press the standard export button for the existing export, or  the fancy 
deluxe export button for the section-generating export **(Dr. Docx RECOMMENDED)**

or
2) set `FORCE_DOCX_SECTIONS = True` in your settings to make *ALL* exports use the new section-setting code and styles

Lots of little individual changes take place along the way, and I don't think enumerating them here makes much sense 
because many don't *directly* affect the formatting. I think the best strategy is to look for problems and surfance them.
